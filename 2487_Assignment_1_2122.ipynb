    "Joana Gonzales is a young professional looking to diversify her investment portfolio. Joana graduated with a Masters in Business Analytics, and after four successful years as a product manager in a tech company, she has managed to save a sizable amount of money. She now wants to start diversifying her savings portfolio. So far, she has focused on traditional investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) and she now wants to look further afield. One asset class she is particularly interested in is peer-to-peer loans issued on online platforms. The high returns advertised by these platforms seem to be an attractive value proposition, and Joana is especially excited by the large amount of data these platforms make publicly available. With her data science background, she is hoping to apply machine learning tools to these data to come up with lucrative investment strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Peer-to-peer lending refers to the practice of lending money to individuals (or small businesses) via online services that match anonymous lenders with borrowers. Lenders can typically earn higher returns relative to savings and investment products offered by banking institutions. However, there is of course the risk that the borrower defaults on his or her loan. Interest rates are usually set by an intermediary platform on the basis of analyzing the borrower's credit (using features such as FICO score, employment status, annual income, debt-to-income ratio, number of open credit lines). The intermediary platform generates revenue by collecting a one-time fee on funded loans (from borrowers) and by charging a loan servicing fee to investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The peer-to-peer lending industry in the United States started in February 2006 with the launch of Prosper, followed by LendingClub. In 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required that peer-to-peer companies register their offerings as securities, pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. Both Prosper and LendingClub gained approval from the SEC to offer investors notes backed by payments received on the loans. One of the interesting features of the peer-to-peer lending market is the richness of the historical data available. The two largest U.S. platforms (LendingClub and Prosper) have chosen to give free access to their data to potential investors. The definition of each loan status is as follows. Current refers to a loan that is still being reimbursed in a timely manner. Late corresponds to a loan on which a payment is between 16 and 120 days overdue. If the payment is delayed by more than 121 days, the loan is considered to be in Default. \n",
